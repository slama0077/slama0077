- 👋 Hi, I’m @slama0077. I am an honors student at The University of Alabama (Junior), double majoring in Computer Science and Maths. 
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection between Maths and Computer Science. For instance, I am interested in creating a logic (program) to solve a certain problem; and at the same time, I am intersted to optimize that logic with any mathematical understanding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any coding projects.
